What I recommend is to download a current filesystem image. Go to after-sight.com/support

Download the zipped image, extract it, and then burn it to a micro SD card with a program like win32diskimager. 

Put the micro SD into the After Sight Model 1, and fire away. 

If you don't do that, there is a laundry list of dependencies to deal with. 

If you need an after sight model 1 (hardware), email mike.mcwilliams@after-sight.com.
